- Push the branch and open a PR against main on the upstream repository.
- In your PR description, include:
- What you changed and why.

### 3. Code & Content Standards

- Keep all content educational and safe ‚Äî avoid adding anything that could be used for unauthorized or malicious purposes.

- Keep Markdown clean and readable (80‚Äì100 character lines recommended).

### 4. File Naming & Structure

Follow the existing organization:
/notes/           ‚Üí study and reference notes
/labs/            ‚Üí sanitized lab write-ups
/cheatsheets/     ‚Üí quick commands and references
/scripts/         ‚Üí helper scripts (safe only)

Use yyyy-mm-dd-topic.md or topic--short-title.md naming for easy sorting.

### 5. Tests & Checks

- This repo mainly contains documentation, so automated tests are minimal.
- If you add scripts, include short usage notes and ensure they‚Äôre safe in isolated lab environments.
- Markdown files may be linted (markdownlint) and link-checked automatically via CI.

### 6. Review Process

- PRs will be reviewed by the repository owner. Expect friendly, constructive feedback.
- The owner may request small changes before merging.
- If your PR is declined, you‚Äôll receive feedback explaining why.
